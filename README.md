> Course by [Prof. Shuo Yang](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/phyen/info/1068/1816.htm), Tsinghua University in Fall 2025

This repository accompanies the **Selected Topics in Computational Quantum Physics** course (Fall 2025). It contains two parts:

1. **Algorithm Implementations & Tutorials** *(continuously updated)*  
   Minimal, well-commented examples of classic and modern algorithms used in computational quantum physics.
2. **Homework** *(released after each official deadline)*  
   Solutions and reference implementations published only after due dates.
